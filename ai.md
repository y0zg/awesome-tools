- **Review**: Always validate AI-generated infrastructure code before deployment
- **Cost Management**: Set usage limits for AI API calls to prevent unexpected costs
- **Progressive Adoption**: Start with non-critical tasks when integrating AI tools
- **Human Oversight**: Keep humans in the loop for critical decisions and reviews
